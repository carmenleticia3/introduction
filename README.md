I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description. 

This project will cover the following topics, or, objectives:

1: Creating a git repository
2: Exploring git operations
3: Configuring Git
4: Editting the file and adding it to the repository
5: Creating a new file and commiting it to the repository
6: Adding an empty file to the repository through web UI

That will be all
